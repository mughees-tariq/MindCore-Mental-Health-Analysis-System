# MindCore – Mental Health Analysis App 🧠

*Type how you feel. Let the model do the rest.*

MindCore is a desktop mental health analysis application built with JavaFX and a Python/Flask ML backend. It classifies your emotional state from free-text journal entries using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model, tracks your mood history over time, and generates a personalised AI consoling report — all running locally on your machine.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

MindCore runs as **two programs** working in tandem:

- **Python Flask API** (`python-api/`) — Loads a fine-tuned DistilBERT model locally and exposes two endpoints: `/predict` for mental health classification and `/generate-report` for AI-generated consoling mood reports via the Hugging Face Inference API.
- **JavaFX Desktop App** (`mental-health-app/`) — The full UI application built with JavaFX 23. Communicates with the Flask API over localhost, persists all user data in a local SQLite database, and handles auth, mood tracking, history, recommendations, and profile management.

## 🛠 Features

### 🤖 ML-Powered Analysis

- **DistilBERT text classification** — Fine-tuned on a mental health dataset; classifies input text into 7 categories: Normal, Stress, Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar, Personality Disorder, and Suicidal
- **Severity scoring** — Each prediction is tagged Low / Moderate / High / Critical
- **Top-3 confidence breakdown** — Shows the top 3 candidate diagnoses with confidence percentages alongside every prediction
- **Smart negation detection** — A custom NLP pre-processing layer handles negated phrases (e.g. "I don't feel anxious") and idiomatic language before passing text to the model
- **AI Consoling Report** — Generates a personalised, empathetic mood report based on your full history using Hugging Face's Inference API (requires free HF token)

### 📊 Dashboard & Mood Tracker

- **Streak tracker** — Tracks consecutive days of mood logging; highlights 7-day streaks
- **Mood line chart** — Interactive JavaFX `LineChart` showing mood scores over time with an average reference line
- **Trend analysis** — Automatically labels your recent mood trend as 📈 Improving, 📉 Declining, or ➡️ Stable
- **Analytics cards** — Best day, worst day, average score, and mood stability index
- **Self-care checklist** — Daily self-care tasks persisted in SQLite; resets each day
- **In-app notifications** — Bell icon with badge count for reminders and alerts

### 🗂️ History & Filtering

- **Full prediction history** — Every analysis entry stored with timestamp, input text, prediction, confidence, severity, tags, and notes
- **Advanced filtering** — Filter by date range, mood type, severity level, confidence range, starred, or keyword search
- **Multiple views** — Toggle between List View, Timeline View, and Compare View
- **Bulk actions** — Star, delete, or export multiple entries at once
- **CSV & JSON export** — Export your full history or current filtered view with or without notes

### 👤 User Management

- **Secure auth** — Register/login with bcrypt-hashed passwords and input validation
- **Forgot password** — Security question-based password recovery
- **Profile management** — Edit display name, email, security question, and emergency contacts
- **Multi-user support** — Each account has its own isolated SQLite-backed history

### 💊 Recommendations

- **Personalised self-care recommendations** — Based on your predicted mental health state
- **Progress tracking** — Tracks recommendation completion across sessions

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- **Windows** (the launcher scripts are Windows-only)
- **Java 21+** — [Download here](https://adoptium.net/)
- **Apache Maven** — [Download here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) — must be on your system `PATH`
- **Python 3.10+** — [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) — must be on your system `PATH`
- A free **Hugging Face account** for the AI Report feature (optional but recommended)

---

## 🔑 Hugging Face API Key Setup (for AI Report Generation)

The Generate Report feature calls the Hugging Face Inference API. It's completely free — just follow these steps:

1. Go to [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. Click **New token** → give it any name → set role to **Read** → click **Create token**
3. Copy the token (starts with `hf_...`)
4. Open `python-api/.env` in any text editor
5. Replace the placeholder:
```
HF_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
```
with your actual token:
```
HF_API_TOKEN=hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
6. Save the file — you're done

> The app works fully without this token. Only the **Generate Report** button on the Mood Tracker screen requires it.

## 🚀 Running the App

### One-click launch (Recommended)

Simply double-click **`run.bat`** in the root folder.

That's it. The launcher will:
- Automatically create a Python virtual environment on first run
- Install all Python dependencies including PyTorch (CPU) — **this takes a few minutes the first time**
- Start the Flask API in the background
- Wait for the ML model to load (~10 seconds)
- Launch the JavaFX app

On every subsequent run it detects the existing environment and starts in just a few seconds.

### Manual launch (Advanced)

If you prefer to run the two programs separately:

**Terminal 1 — Start the Python API:**
```bash
cd python-api
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

**Terminal 2 — Start the Java app** (once the API is running):
```bash
cd mental-health-app
mvn clean compile javafx:run
```
